Love You may be the best way to get your message across. 
 
 This is a great time for you and your partner to bond over certain aspects of their relationship. It could even lead to some very interesting discussions on what has gone wrong. 
 
 Your relationship is not going well, so this can prove quite difficult. 
 
 However, if there are any issues that need sorting out, then it will certainly make things easier between you. 
 
 The key thing about dealing with these problems is that they have been holding you back. They cannot ignore you, but now is your chance to tackle them head on. 
 
 There is no point in trying to hide away from them, as this only makes matters worse - instead deal head-on by making sure you address each issue head-on.
