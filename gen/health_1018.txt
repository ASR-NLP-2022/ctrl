Health You may have noticed that you are feeling a little more than usual. This is because your body has been in the process of changing for some time. If this isn't exactly what you're looking for, then you'll find it difficult to get out and about. Even if it's not your intention at all, there will be times when you need to go out. So make sure you stick with it!
 Your energy levels might seem low, but don't worry. It doesn't mean anything bad about you. It's just part of being human. When you feel like this, you won't want to stand still - even though you know it's good for you! Just keep moving forward! The best way to do so is by doing something completely different. Something totally off the beaten track. You're going to have to try things you've never done before.
