Health You may be able to make an appointment with a therapist or psychologist, but don't expect anything in the way of professional help from them. The most important thing you can do for yourself is take care not to let your mind get too clouded by this event. Just like when you are going through some tough times, it will have its effect on you, and if you go along with it, then you'll just end up looking foolish. 
 
 What about you? Are you feeling more than usual? Do you feel as though something big has been happening around you?! Don't think that it's only you. It could happen to anyone, and you won't know what hit you. This doesn't mean you should ignore it. It's simply part of life. Be patient. Your body needs time to adjust to whatever it does.
